1.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
A.Using the diff -u old_file.txt new_file.txt helped me see the bug between these two versions of the file as for every line that was different from was pointed out by the version control.

2.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A.Suppose that I have a long file that has been changed to a different file having a lot of changes done in it. Then having an easy access to the entire history will increase the efficiency of the code and I would thus be a better programmer.

3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A.Pros of manually creating commit is that after only a logical change our file can be saved and not automatically, if the file is saved automatically then we maybe in the middle of a line of code which gets saved and thus is of no use afterwards.
Cons of manually saving commit is that we might tend to forget to save our file and commit them. This will result in loss of our code.
