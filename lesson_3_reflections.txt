Q)When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A)I would want to make a remote repository when I want to make changes to the file on the GitHub directly. If I choose to keep working then I would have to make commits regurarly and then in the end push the file to GitHub.
Q)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A)I would want to pull changes manually beacuse I may be in the middle of some work and if Git copies the incomplete file into its repository then it would lead to an error. Thus completing a logical task and then pulling the changes manually is the best option.
